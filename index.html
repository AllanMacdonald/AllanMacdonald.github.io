    <p>Today I missed not seeing the urang utan in the tree. He didn't hang there nor did he hide. Where on earth did he go....Hold it, I found him, he's behind a keyboard in a dark room. Surely this was not right. Who would think that an uran utan would really I mean really prefer a dark room and a keyboard to hanging leisurely in a tree outside. Not just at any time and tree, no, a special time and a special tree.  This one had leaves falling as the breeze would stroke its branches. Imagine the sound of colour falling on your face as you look up. How special is that? Surely better than a keyboard in a dark room? This special time would of course be Autumn. That is always when the leaves fall down to the ground in our garden.</p>
